# üîç Logo-Grouper (Veridion Challenge)

**Logo-Grouper** is a Python tool built to extract and group visually similar logos from a large list of domains. It uses perceptual hashing and graph-based clustering to efficiently match logos that look alike, even when they differ in size, color, or compression.

Designed to work at scale, Logo-Grouper extracts logos using multiple fallback methods, validates them for quality, hashes them using `pHash`, and clusters similar ones using a similarity graph.

## üîë How It Works

Logo-Grouper processes each domain in three key steps: logo retrieval, perceptual hashing, and similarity-based grouping using a graph structure.

### 1. Logo Retrieval (Multi-Level Fallback)

To maximize accuracy and coverage, logos are extracted using multiple prioritized sources:

- **HTML `<link rel="icon">`** ‚Äì Parses the homepage to find explicitly declared favicons.
- **Clearbit API** ‚Äì Attempts to fetch a high-quality logo for the domain.
- **DuckDuckGo Icon API** ‚Äì Grabs lightweight, cached icons.
- **Fallback to `/favicon.ico`** ‚Äì Standard browser location.

Each image is validated:

- Minimum size of 32x32 pixels  
- Basic visual complexity (avoiding blank, transparent, or uniform icons)  
- Converted to RGB/RGBA for consistent processing  

If none of the sources provide a high-quality logo, the system falls back to the first available image.

### 2. Perceptual Hashing

Each valid image is converted into a 64-bit perceptual hash using `imagehash.phash()`. This type of hash:

- Encodes the visual structure of an image  
- Is robust to scaling, compression, and minor color changes  
- Allows fast, meaningful comparisons using Hamming distance  

### 3. Similarity-Based Grouping

- The system computes Hamming distance between all logo hashes.  
- Two domains are considered similar if their hash distance ‚â§ **threshold** (default: `10`).  
- These similarities are represented in an undirected graph, where:  
  - **Nodes** = domains  
  - **Edges** = visual similarity  
- The **connected components** of the graph form final logo groups.

The result is a list of clusters, each containing domains that share visually similar branding.
